Take a look at the JSON Mapping tool available within QEWD-Ripple

{% include image.html file="/qewd/JSON_TrToolv1.png" alt="Jekyll" caption="This is a startup view of the QEWD Content Store" %}

This is built to address the very common requirements to map data from JSON to JSON/ XML to JSON/ etc. (NB For healthcare purposes it also caters for HL7v2 messages)

See slightly older version with some sample data in here

{% include image.html file="/qewd/JSON_TrToolv2.png" alt="Jekyll" caption="This is a startup view of the QEWD Content Store" %}


See the tool in action from here, available in standalone and embedded within QEWD-Ripple
